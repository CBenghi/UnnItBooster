Dear {SUB_FirstName}, 

as we have recently marked your BE1178 submission, I'm now writing to inform you of the outcome. 
At this stage your mark is unconfirmed; marks become confirmed after the Programme Assessment Board, that is scheduled for the week commencing 12th of June.
Your marks will be visible on formal transcripts shortly after that. 

You will find your feedback and unconfirmed mark after my signature below. 
I remain available for any questions you might have. 

Best regards, 
Claudio
