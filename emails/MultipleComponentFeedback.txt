Dear {First}, 

as we have recently marked your KB7038 submissions, I'm now writing to inform you of the outcome. 

At this stage your mark is unconfirmed; marks become confirmed after the Programme Assessment Board, scheduled for tomorrow, the 15th of June.
Your marks will be visible on formal transcripts shortly after that. 

You will find your feedback and unconfirmed mark after my signature below. 
I remain available for any questions you might have. 

Best regards, 
Claudio
