Dear {FirstName}, 

as you might know I've recently been allocated as your personal tutor. Welcome on board. 

I'm just writing to ensure that you know about this and have an easy way to make contact, if you wish.

As a starting point I thought I pointed you to guiding notes on tutorship: https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/static/5007/arpdf/personaltutoringpolicy 

Feel free to get in touch via email or text on 07882 490 525. 

All best,
Thanks,
Claudio
