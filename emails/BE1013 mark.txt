Dear {SUB_FirstName}, 

as we have recently marked your BE1013 submission, I'm now writing to inform you of the outcome. 

At this stage your mark is unconfirmed; marks become confirmed after the MSc Surveying and Construction DL Programme Assessment Board, that is scheduled for Thursday the 9th of March.
Your marks will be visible on formal transcripts shortly after that.

With the occasion I'd like to apologise for the delay in the provision of feedback, I initially intended to return your mark much faster than the 20 working days expected turnaround time for the University, however I was not able to, and under pressure I've also made a couple of mistakes handling the relevant communication. I hope this was not a major inconvenience for you; please accept my apologies as I had to revert to the 20 working days deadline.

You will find your feedback and unconfirmed mark after my signature below.
I remain available for any questions you might have.

Best regards, 
Claudio
